# DocRepo progress

DocRepo is being rebuilt on the owner's personal computer, starting 2026-10-08. The first version's phases 0 to 2, built on the corporate computer, are replaced.

## Phases

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Skeleton and safety: the data root's location, settings, guarded writes, logging, the command line, and the network-module scan | Done. Tested on the corporate computer (2026-10-09): pip install, pytest and the command checks |
| 2 | Database and task model: schema, IDs, the task tree, labels, people, logs, recurrence, days until due, the capacity calendar, and the generated pages, checked against the mockup's test vectors and examples | Built and hand-tested by the owner 2026-10-16; on GitHub 2026-10-16. Next: testing on the corporate computer with phase 3 |
| 3 | Capture app: tray, hotkey, the capture window (task picker, the Note, New task and Update capture types, Parse and populate, Copy prompt, mods log), saving captures, text extraction, Outlook emails and LAN paths | Built and hand-tested by the owner 2026-10-16 (3a); on GitHub 2026-10-16. Next: testing on the corporate computer, including 3b (Outlook), which can only be tested there |
| 4 | Browse tool: the views, task and capture pages, agendas, capacity, people, labels, documents, search, and Settings | Built 2026-10-17. Next: the owner's hand test here, then testing on the corporate computer |
| 5 | First everyday version: Startup shortcut, backups, the one-time Excel import of the project list, and the README | Not started |
| 6 | Document tracking: change checks, diffs, replaced saved copies, and relinking moved files | Not started |

## Decisions

- Python 3.12.6, the same version as on the corporate computer.
- Packages: the seven approved in the first version's Phase 0, at the same versions, pinned in `requirements.txt` with their dependencies. extract-msg isn't used; `.msg` files are read through Outlook.
- Default hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+Space.
- No paths in the code. The data root's location is kept in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DocRepo\location.json`; everything else is in `<data root>\Config\settings.json` and is edited in the browse tool's Settings view.
- Publish to GitHub after phase 1, to test the route to the corporate computer early.
- The GitHub repo is public (2026-10-09), so the corporate computer can download it without signing in to GitHub. Nothing personal or company-related may go into it.

## Code layout (phase 1)

- `docrepo/safe_fs.py`: the only module that writes, copies, moves or creates folders. See SPEC section 4.
- `docrepo/config.py`: the data root's location (`location.json`), `Settings` (`Config\settings.json`), the OneDrive and code-folder checks, `make_safe_fs` and `init_data_root`.
- `docrepo/log_setup.py`: the rotating log in `System\logs`.
- `docrepo/cli.py`: the commands `where`, `set-data-root`, `init` and `try-write`.
- `tests/`: the guard (including `..`, junctions and symlinks), the network-module scan, settings and the command line. 53 pass; the symlink test is skipped because this Windows account can't create symlinks, the same as on the corporate computer.

## Code layout (phase 2)

- `docrepo/db.py`: `docs.db`, its schema and version, transactions, and IDs. See SPEC section 6.1.
- `docrepo/dates.py`, `docrepo/schedule.py`: dates as stored and shown; windows, next occurrences and days until due.
- `docrepo/model.py`: a read-only snapshot of the database and the rules that read it (the tree, scopes, inherited labels, raw text logs, summaries, files, the status log, agendas, unfiled captures).
- `docrepo/tasks.py`, `docrepo/people.py`, `docrepo/agenda.py`, `docrepo/captures.py`: the writes. Task changes go into the status log and rebuild the task's calendar rows in the same transaction. `captures.py` also writes `capture.md`.
- `docrepo/capacity.py`: the capacity calendar (`work_calendar`), unestimated and unscheduled tasks. `docrepo/lists.py`: the six lists.
- `docrepo/pages.py`: `Task.md` and `Contents.md`. `docrepo/text.py`: sentences and capture titles. `docrepo/report.py`: the `report` command's text.
- `docrepo/sample.py` and `docrepo/sample/sample-data.json`: the made-up sample data and `load-sample`.
- `tests/`: 65 new tests. `tests/fixtures/` holds the mockup's `examples.md` and `test-vectors.md`; every generated page, the `capture.md` examples and the report's tables match them line for line.

## Decisions (phase 2)

- The sample data's labels are Line 1, Line 2 and Strategic Plan, so nothing from real work is in the public repo.
- Agenda entries in a status log are worked out from `agenda_items`, not stored twice.
- A capture's content text stays in its `capture.md`; the database keeps its title.
- A generated page is rewritten only when more than its "Generated on" line changes.
- `report` writes UTF-8 when its output goes to a file.

## Code layout (phase 3)

- `docrepo/parse.py`: Parse and populate, ported from the mockup's `parse.js`. `tests/test_parse_vectors.py` runs all of `test-vectors.md`'s captures and date phrases.
- `docrepo/save.py`: saving a capture (the draft, the checks, one transaction, then the files). `docrepo/extract.py`: text from files, file checksums, mapped drives as network paths.
- `docrepo/prompts.py`: summary types and Copy prompt. `docrepo/mods.py`: the mods log.
- `docrepo/hotkey.py`: RegisterHotKey through ctypes. `docrepo/outlook.py`: Outlook through COM (phase 3b).
- `docrepo/app.py`: the tray, single copy, hotkey, reminders, daily work and the first-start question. `docrepo/ui/`: the capture window, task picker, chip pickers, mods log panel, help texts (generated from the mockup's `HELP`) and style.
- `docrepo/db.py`: schema version 2, brought up from version 1 when a database is opened.
- `tests/`: 288 new tests, 242 of them Parse and populate's vectors. The capture window and the app are tested offscreen (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`), so no window appears.

## Decisions (phase 3)

- Saving runs on the window's own thread, because Outlook's COM objects belong to it. The window shows a busy cursor; a big file on the LAN can take a moment.
- Only one copy of the app runs per data root, through a lock file in `System`. A second copy finds the first's window and asks it, with a registered Windows message, to show itself. (Qt's local sockets are in QtNetwork, which the network rule bans.)
- An email's attachments are saved only with the capture, so Copy prompt can't include their text before then: DocRepo has nowhere else it may write them.
- Until the browse tool exists, clicking a reminder opens the capture window on that task with Update checked.
- The label, people and agenda pickers show their suggestions in a list under the box, not a floating popup, so typing never loses focus.
- The capture window uses Segoe UI, which every Windows 10 and 11 computer has.

## Code layout (phase 4)

- `docrepo/views.py`: what the middle pane lists (the task tree, the lists and Documents in tree form, unfiled captures, agendas, the capacity grid), the date cells and the view counts.
- `docrepo/stories.py`: the status log and raw text log as stories, ported from the mockup's `storyOf` and `noteItem`.
- `docrepo/detail.py`: the task, capture, document, person and label pages as HTML, and the capacity view's details. Its links (`task:`, `tab:`, `chap:` and so on) are handled by the window; none leaves DocRepo.
- `docrepo/search.py`: the search index (`search_text`, schema version 3) and searching. `docrepo/edits.py`: the browse tool's changes (filing, fixing a capture, clearing a reminder, closing an agenda item, task edits and moves).
- `docrepo/ui/browse_window.py`: the window. `docrepo/ui/tree_view.py`: the list with HTML cells and the group colours. `docrepo/ui/settings_view.py`, `docrepo/ui/dialogs.py`, `docrepo/ui/explorer.py` (File Explorer only).
- Also changed: `save.py` (Make it a task, the search index, what Save did for the browse tool), `capture_window.py` (opening with an agenda target or from an unfiled capture), `tasks.py` (Description in the status log, `move_parent`), `prompts.py` (content text, `raw_text_all` and `file_text` for a task), `captures.py` (reading content text back from capture.md), `app.py` (Open browse tool, reminders open the Reminders list, the hotkey from Settings), `cli.py` (`browse`; `rebuild` rebuilds the search index too).
- `tests/`: 119 new tests (526 pass in all). `tests/fixtures/stories.json` is the mockup's `exportStories`: every sample task's story and raw text log, checked entry for entry. The views are checked against the mockup's rows. The window is tested offscreen.

## Decisions (phase 4)

- The browse tool runs inside the app, sharing its database connection and capture window, so the two never disagree. `browse` starts the app if it isn't running.
- The detail pane is a QTextBrowser showing HTML built by `docrepo/detail.py`, so the pages are tested as text without Qt. Captured text is always escaped, never shown as markup.
- Moving a task in the tree is done from the task page's Edit menu (Move from under, Also put under, Take out from under), with the task picker, not by dragging.
- The browse tool never opens or runs a document: Show in File Explorer only starts File Explorer, in line with the rule against launching attachments. Open original, Check now and Relink wait for phase 6.
- Search finds items holding every word typed, anywhere in their text, as the mockup's search does with one phrase. Captures' and documents' text is copied into `search_text` in docs.db; tasks, people and labels are searched in their own tables.
- Make it a task files the unfiled capture to the new task instead of making a second capture. The capture keeps its own content text; the new task's description is what was in the window.
- Copy prompt for a task sends the latest raw text log entry's content text (not just its title), and `raw_text_all` and `file_text` now work for a task too.
- A status log value with line breaks stays on one line in `Task.md`.
- DocRepo's windows stay light even when Windows is in dark mode (found in the owner's first hand test, 2026-10-17). Qt follows Windows' dark mode and drew its controls dark under DocRepo's light colours, which hid text in both windows. A dark look could come later; it would need dark versions of every colour.

## Unfinished / notes

- Phase 4 is built and its automated tests pass; it hasn't been hand-tested yet. Not covered by the automated tests: how the window looks with the real Windows style (the tests draw it offscreen), File Explorer opening, the tray menu and reminder clicks, and the Settings view's folder pickers.

- Phases 2 and 3 passed the owner's hand tests on this computer and went to GitHub together on 2026-10-16 (brainstorm round 12).
- To test on the corporate computer: Outlook emails (dragging from Outlook, Add selected Outlook email, a dropped `.msg` file, email.msg and attachments in the capture folder, any Outlook security prompt), mapped drives recorded as network paths, files on the LAN drive, and the hotkey there.
- The Startup shortcut comes in phase 5; until then the app is started by hand.
- On the corporate computer, phase 4 needs the same checks as phases 2 and 3, plus the browse tool on the real data root (search over real captures, File Explorer on the LAN drive).

- `SPEC.md` covers phases 1 to 4 in full; later phases are summaries until they're built. The detailed design is in the parent workspace's `docs/task-model/brainstorm.md`.
- Published to the GitHub repo `eckertco2/DocRepo` on 2026-10-09 (phase 1), and on 2026-10-16 (the glossary, phases 2 and 3).
- The route to the corporate computer works (2026-10-09): download, a security scan there, `pip install -r requirements.txt` with every pinned version available, and pytest passing.
